# Build a Website with HTML, CSS and GitHub Pages

## Projects
- Fashion Blog

### Project 1: Fashion Blog
#### Description
Your friend Isa is a budding fashion blogger, and she's asked you to build her a new website, just in time for New York Fashion Wee! Use your new HTML knowledge to create the underlying structure of the blog. Make sure to include plenty of pictures, links, lists and other HTML elements that you've learned so that her fans have plenty to read.

#### Improvements I Made

Beyond the initial specifications, I:

- Replaced the \<h3> tag used for the profile photo to improve accessibility for screen readers by correcting the heading hierarchy. I created a figure element with a caption for better structure.
- Enhanced the pageâ€™s appearance with additional styling for a more polished look.
- Refactored the webpage structure using semantic HTML tags such as header and footer:
  - Moved the existing \<h1> into a newly created header.
  - Added a footer containing contact information.
- Separated the blog section from user information and the introduction, creating clearer, more specific sections.
- Converted the blog entries into interactive thumbnails to streamline the browsing experience:
  - Added JavaScript elements for mouse interaction, making the thumbnails responsive.
  - Enabled a "pop-out" window effect when thumbnails are clicked for an immersive experience.
