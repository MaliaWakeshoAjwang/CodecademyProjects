# Build a Website with HTML, CSS and GitHub Pages

## Projects
- Fashion Blog

### Project 1: Fashion Blog
#### Description
Your friend Isa is a budding fashion blogger, and she's asked you to build her a new website, just in time for New York Fashion Wee! Use your new HTML knowledge to create the underlying structure of the blog. Make sure to include plenty of pictures, links, lists and other HTML elements that you've learned so that her fans have plenty to read.
#### Improvement I made
Beyond the specification I: 
- Updated the \<h3> tag that was for the profile photo as it was not accessible for screen reader users as it did not follow the heading hierarchy. I instead created a figure and put a figure caption.
- added styling to the page to make it look better.
- divided the initial webpage into divs and used semantic HTML tags such as headers and footers.
  - created header and moved h1 into it
  - created a footer and added contact information into it
